# Make a difference: join the OS SIG Committee!

**Nominations for the OHBM Open Science Special Interest Group (OS SIG) committee for OHBM 2025 are OPEN!!!**

The open-science movement is one of the best things happening in neuroscience. Hackathons, open-science room, new tools and methods, reproducibility and reliability, open access and inclusivity: the OS SIG is the place where it’s all happening!

If open-science excites you and you want to help push its frontiers, please consider applying for a position in the OS SIG! 

[Early career researchers](https://www.ohbmtrainees.com/), BIPOC, LGBTQ+, and people from outside Europe and North America especially encouraged to apply! 

All OS SIG officers have reduced registration for OHBM 2025!

We have MANY opportunities to get involved with open-science and OHBM if you think nominating yourself for a position in the OS SIG is more time than you’d like to commit, please reach out to us about volunteering!

We are looking for a group of interested volunteers to help coordinate the international effort of creating Hackathons and the Open-science Room!
