# Make a difference: join the OS SIG Committee!

**Nominations for the OHBM Open Science Special Interest Group (OS SIG) committee for OHBM 2024 are OPEN!!!**

The open-science movement is one of the best things happening in neuroscience. Hackathons, open-science room, new tools and methods, reproducibility and reliability, open access and inclusivity: the OS SIG is the place where itâ€™s all happening!

If open-science excites you and you want to help push its frontiers, please consider applying for a position in the OS SIG! 

[Early career researchers](https://www.ohbmtrainees.com/), BIPOC, LGBTQ+, and people from outside Europe and North America especially encouraged to apply! 

All OS SIG officers have reduced or no-cost registration for OHBM 2024!

We have MANY opportunities to get involved with open-science and OHBM if you think nominating yourself for a position in the OS SIG is more time than youâ€™d like to commit, please reach out to us about volunteering!

We are looking for a group of interested volunteers to help coordinate the international effort of creating Hackathons and the Open-science Room!
