**Nominations for the OHBM Open Science Special Interest Group (OS SIG) committee members for OHBM 2026 are OPEN!!!**

The Open Science SIG is part of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM). Its mission is to promote inclusivity, openness, and transparency in neuroimaging and neuroscience. The group is best known for organizing the OHBM Hackathon and the Open Science Room.

The open-science movement is one of the best things happening in neuroscience. Hackathons, open-science room, new tools and methods, reproducibility and reliability, open access and inclusivity: the OS SIG is the place where it’s all happening!

Joining the Open Science SIG is a great opportunity to meet new people, learn from leaders in the field, and most importantly make a meaningful impact on open-science practices within the OHBM community.

If open-science excites you and you want to help push its frontiers, please consider applying for a position in the OS SIG!
