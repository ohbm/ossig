**The Open Science Special Interest Group is pleased to offer 20 travel awards that will include free registration at the hackathon plus $500 USD that will go towards covering part of the expenses incurred to attend the hackathon.**

We hope to bring together a diverse and exciting cohort of researchers to collaborate at the OHBM BrainHack and TrainTrack event, June 23-25 in Montreal.

In the application, we ask you to write no more than 1500 characters on your motivations to attend the Hackathon (Brainhack and/or Traintrack), in particular we would like to hear about what you hope to learn and what you will bring to the community. Your application will be considered for a $500 (US) travel award to support your attendance and free registration at the OHBM Hackathon.

Due to the limited numbers of travel awards available, they will go in priority to those with financial needs. We will then look specifically for: (1) openness: Do you plan to work in a project designed for open collaboration (for example, the project where you want to work has created a GitHub repo, a channel on Brainhack mattermost or Gitter, etc.), and (2) inclusivity: Do you think about how to integrate people with different backgrounds to work with you?

If you have any question, you can contact to the event organizers at ossig2019@inria.fr. 

**Submit your application no later than March 8th, 2020: [Apply now!](https://framaforms.org/ohbm-hackathon-travel-award-application-1581436686)**
