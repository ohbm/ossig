# At OSSIG, we are committed to maintaining transparency in all of our operations.

Here, we provide open access to our inclusivity and diversity recruitment reports, budget summaries, and annual reports to ensure full accountability.

<!-- more formal? -->
<!-- # OSSIG is committed to upholding the highest standards of transparency in its operations.

On this page, you will find our reports on diversity and inclusivity in recruitment, detailed budget expenditures, and our annual organizational summaries. -->

<!-- Could you mock up the new tab on the website and present it at the next OSSIG general meeting? I think the idea is to label the tab 'Transparency'. Then the simplest solution would be to create a table with a section for 2025 and under that we can link to the Officer Recruitment Report and the 2025 Budget (need to ask Veronica/Naomi for a finalized version) and we can also upload the 2025 Annual Report that is turned into the Executive Office. And then there will be a blank section for 2026 where we upload our documents this time next year -->
