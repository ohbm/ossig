# Maximizing scientific efficiency through sustainability, reproducibility, and FAIRness

- This OHBM 2025 Educational Course is organized as a joint effort between the OHBM Open Science and Sustainability and Environmental Action Special Interest Groups (OS-SIG/SEA-SIG).

- Adopting sustainable, FAIR-aligned (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) approaches to data sharing and processing is still limited across the field and the environmental impact of high computational demands in neuroimaging research is a growing concern.

- Presenters will introduce principles and best practices in FAIR data sharing, sustainable computing, and open science, alongside practical tutorials on tools and techniques for creating transparent, reproducible workflows. 

- By addressing these topics as an educational course, this program aims to lower current barriers for FAIR principles, foster a culture of reproducibility and sustainability, and promote resource efficiency in the neuroimaging community.
